    //this program calculates taxes
    /*
     In an imaginary country called Lisarb, all the people are very happy to pay their taxes because they know that
     doesnâ€™t exist corrupt politicians and the taxes are used to benefit the population, without any misappropriation.
     The currency of this country is Rombus, whose symbol is R$.

    Read a value with 2 digits after the decimal point, equivalent to the salary of a Lisarb inhabitant.
     Then print the due value that this person must pay of taxes, according to the table below.
    Salary	            | Readjustment Rate,%
    -------------------------------------------
    0 - 2000.00         | without taxes
    2000.01 - 3,000.00  | 8
    3,000.01 - 4,500.00 | 18
    Above 4,500.00      | 28

    Remember, if the salary is R$ 3,002.00 for example, the rate of 8% is only over R$ 1,000.00, because the salary
     from R$ 0.00 to R$ 2,000.00 is tax free. In the follow example,
     the total rate is 8%
     over R$ 1000.00 + 18% over R$ 2.00, resulting in R$ 80.36 at all.
     The answer must be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point.

    Input
    The input contains only a float-point number, with 2 digits after the decimal point.

    Output
    Print the message "R$" followed by a blank space and the total tax to be payed, with two digits after the decimal point.
     If the value is up to 2000, print the message "Isento".
